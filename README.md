# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Program Description

This program has create, delete, fetch and update functionality with a MySQL server. 

## How to run: 
1. cd MySql-server-example
2. npm install
3. run npm start
4. open a new terminal and do cd MySql-server-example/server and then run npm init and press enter to all questions.
5. npm install mysql express
6. npm install nodemon
7. npm install cors
8. npm install body-parser
9. run npm run devStart

**You need a MySql instance running demodatabase and need to run the following statements:
Create database Demodatabase;
CREATE TABLE `demodatabase`.`new_table` (
  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `dataName` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  `dataValue` TEXT(500) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`));

and you may need to execute the following code in MySql if you're encountering errors:
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
flush privileges;
**You should replace 'password' with your password

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run devStart`

Runs the server part of the program on http://localhost:3004.
http://localhost:3004/api/get will show you the entries in the
mysql database. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
